# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the domain configuration issues for the vaccine hospital service. The system needs to properly configure custom domains (vaccinehomehospital.co.th and www.vaccinehomehospital.co.th) with correct DNS settings to ensure the service is accessible to users. Currently, the domains show DNS update requirements and need proper CNAME/ANAME record configuration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure custom domains properly, so that users can access the vaccine hospital service through the intended domain names.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the domain vaccinehomehospital.co.th is accessed THEN the system SHALL redirect to the correct service endpoint
2. WHEN the www subdomain is accessed THEN the system SHALL properly route to the main service
3. WHEN DNS records are configured THEN the system SHALL verify domain ownership successfully
4. IF DNS provider supports ANAME records THEN the system SHALL use ANAME pointing to line-intent-router-bot.onrender.com
5. IF DNS provider does not support ANAME records THEN the system SHALL use A record pointing to 216.24.57.1

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the vaccine hospital service through a custom domain, so that I can easily remember and trust the service URL.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to vaccinehomehospital.co.th THEN the system SHALL load the vaccine hospital interface
2. WHEN I navigate to www.vaccinehomehospital.co.th THEN the system SHALL load the same interface
3. WHEN the domain is accessed THEN the system SHALL display proper SSL certificates
4. WHEN the service loads THEN the system SHALL maintain all functionality available on the default domain

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor domain configuration status, so that I can quickly identify and resolve any DNS issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN domain verification is pending THEN the system SHALL display clear status indicators
2. WHEN DNS configuration is incorrect THEN the system SHALL provide specific instructions for resolution
3. WHEN domain verification succeeds THEN the system SHALL update the status to "Enabled"
4. IF domain configuration fails THEN the system SHALL provide troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage multiple domain configurations, so that I can support different access patterns and subdomains.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a new custom domain THEN the system SHALL validate the domain format
2. WHEN configuring subdomains THEN the system SHALL support both www and non-www variants
3. WHEN removing a domain THEN the system SHALL safely disable routing without affecting other domains
4. WHEN domains are configured THEN the system SHALL maintain a render subdomain as fallback
